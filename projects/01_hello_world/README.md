# Hello World Flutter App

My first Flutter application! This simple app demonstrates basic Flutter concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding StatelessWidget
- Using MaterialApp and Scaffold
- Working with basic widgets (Text, Icon, Column, Card)
- Applying Material Design theming
- App structure and organization

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. StatelessWidget
- Widgets that don't change over time
- Immutable UI components
- Rebuild when parent widget changes

### 2. MaterialApp
- Root widget for Material Design apps
- Provides theme, navigation, and localization

### 3. Scaffold
- Basic app structure with AppBar, body, floating action button
- Material Design layout structure

### 4. Widget Tree
- Hierarchical structure of widgets
- Parent-child relationships
- Understanding the widget lifecycle

## Code Structure

```
lib/
└── main.dart    # Main application entry point
```

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd projects/01_hello_world
   ```

2. Get dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add interactivity with StatefulWidget
- [ ] Implement button interactions
- [ ] Add navigation to other screens
- [ ] Experiment with different widgets and layouts
